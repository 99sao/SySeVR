Project Basic Environment:
joern 0.3.1 + neo4j 2.1.5 + python 3.6 + tensorflow 1.6 + gensim 3.4
GPU（ GTX 1080） *2

Project Basic Process:

1. Get Slices: Use joern to parse source code, and then start neo4j to generate
slices with python files in First Step executed in order.And finally, use the last python
file data_preprocess.py in First Step to write the label of every slice to the last line of
the slice.

2. Data Preprocess: This step includes getting corpus,training word2vec model,
converting tokens into vectors,cutting vectors with python files in Second Step
executed in order. Training word2vec model needs to adjust parameters.

3. Deep Learning Model: Use bgru.py in Third Step to train bgru model, and then
test. This step needs to activate tensorflow environment first.
